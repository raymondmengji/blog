# Why I am starting a blog (or attempting to)

After graduating university over 1.5 years ago and starting my career as a Software Engineer, I've realized coding surprisingly makes up a smaller percentage of what I do day-to-day. Besides the other usual tasks that make up a SWE job (I'm sure everyone loves triaging JIRA tickets), I spend a good chunk of my time writing and reading technical docs (i.e. design docs).

Over time, I've come to appreciate a well-written technical doc. In addition to generally being able to learn something new, the process of writing, revising and polishing a technical idea into something which is understandable to others is quite enjoyable to me.

Through this blog, I can hopefully turn this process from not only something I do as part of my job, but also into a real hobby as well as improve my technical/writing skills. If even only one of those goals materializes, then I will consider this as a success! ðŸ˜€
