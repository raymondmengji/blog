description: A fun joke to vent some stress for students and staff alike.

The first day of April has always attracted mixed reactions from students and
staff alike, usually by those on the receiving end of a joke (though those who
give jokes can often by ambivalent, too). For those unaware, April 1st is
generally regarded as a day for people to play jokes one another and mess with
the truth a little for the sake of light-hearted fun.

## The "Usual" Joke

Unfortunately, a joke that goes gets used quite frequently by course staff is
to "announce" an upcoming midterm through a logistics post, email blast, or
some other course-wide communication. I don't exactly blame people for doing
this; it maximizes the reaction from students while (usually) minimizing the
amount of thought and creative effort that has to go into actually coming up
with and planning the joke. I'm an uncreative person, and I'd probably come up
with that too.

The main issue that I've seen is that these jokes can be moments of very, very
intense stress, even if only brief. How would you feel if you _actually_ forgot
that you had a midterm, performance review, or meeting with your boss for which
you haven't prepared at all? Probably not great.

Is this going to be a big deal in the grand scheme of a semester or even a day?
No, probably not. The most common response I get when I this up is that "It's
just an April Fools' joke!" or "Oh, they'll know it's a joke," and I completely
agree with those statements. I maintain that it's a disservice to "baby"
students and neuter every interaction we have with them for the sake of "What
if X is perceived in this way?" (Though it is not to say that the amount of
thought that should be put be zero.)

That said, small moments of stress add up. No matter how quickly a student
realizes that there is no midterm or how little they may care about their grade
in the course, it's going to be at least a moment or two of panic for most
people. And even if we don't pretend to be allergic to stress, it's still the
duty of staff to minimize _unnecessary_ stress. And to be clear: **April Fools'
counts as unnecessary.**

## Small Moments of Fun

I don't think this means that April Fools' as a concept should be abolished.
When done right, it's quite fun! And I think it's an opportunity for courses to
be a bit more playful than they usually get to be in student interactions. The
day happens to fall between spring break and the end of the semester, a 5-week
period when students have no breaks or or long weekends.  That's not fun, and
it's especially at these times that lightening the mood, even just slightly,
can be welcome and helpful. As much as small moments of stress add up, small
moments of fun relaxation add up, too! Obviously, a well-executed joke won't
solve systemic issues within a university environment, but there's something to
be said about giving thought and time to the small moments of fun, as well.

For the last few Aprils, [CS 161](https://cs161.org/) at UC Berkeley (the
course I teach) has actively chosen to avoid the "surprise midterm" April
Fools' jokes and, in the process, had a little more fun with it: (expected)
midterms held over Club Penguin, a legitimate invitation to breach the email
account of a TA, and a pancake-themed change of course direction. The feedback
has always been positive and, crucially, these jokes escape the "I almost had a
heart attack" comments from students who, while relieved, had one more moment
of unnecessary stress than they would have had otherwise. The full archive of
jokes we've run in CS 161 is available at the bottom of this post.

## The Doggos

As for this semester, I and a couple of head TAs from other courses decided to
work together to re-theme our courses around dogs ("doggos"). This theme was
chosen... entirely at random, only because I walked past a couple of dogs
hosted by [Paws for Mental Health](https://pawsformentalhealth.org/) (whose
work also revolves around "small moments of fun"), but it was something we had
a laugh about as course staff and started planning.

We each undertook a subset of four possible changes:

- Re-title our course websites to reflect some "doggo-fied" title (one of my
  favorites was _EE 120: Signals and Systems_ becoming _Woofs and Tail Wags_)
- Re-title our course Piazza and make a fake announcement post
- Re-title our course Gradescope
- Add a course logo (or modify an existing one) that was somehow related to
  dogs

Some courses even went through the trouble of renaming every single lecture and
assigned reading temporarily (shoutout to CS 152/252A!), which was above and
beyond what we expected!

Our group of cross-course TAs includes a couple artists, so we asked them to
come up with logos for us. They're really awesome, and a gallery of them is
also available at the bottom of this post.

On top of working with head TAs and instructors of other courses, we also
managed to convinced [Vanshaj Singhania](https://vanshaj.dev/), current head of
software in CS 61A, to temporarily rename the 61A Office Hours Queue to the
"DoggOH Park," which was a nice touch.

I want to emphasize that jokes like these are _useful_ in giving students and
staff a moment to step back from stress and laugh, but they can't _solve_ the
issue of stress. Most of the other posts on this blog are meant to address more
systemic issues within student support and equity---this post does not join
their ranks.

But as important as those topics are, it's important to not disregard the
smaller opportunities we have to impact student lives. My hope is that we can
learn to cultivate fewer little moments of stress and more little moments of
fun---the little moments matter, too!

#### Extra Credit Opportunity [Spring 2020]

Hey all, considering how hectic the last few weeks have been, staff has decided
to open up an extra credit opportunity.

For the next 48 hours, you have legal permission to hack me for extra credit.

The amount of extra credit earned will directly correlate with the difficulty
of the hack as follows:

- Display "Ryan is bad at security" on my personal website \-\-> 1/3 of a
  letter grade
- Find a vulnerability in Delphi, which you first reveal as a question during
  our talk \-\-> **2/3 of a letter grade**
- Take over my LinkedIn and add "I got fired for being being bad at security"
  under the description for each job \-\-> **1 letter grade**
- Hack my CalCentral and enroll me in 161 over the summer \-\-> **4/3 letter
  grades**
- Compromise my email and ask ERSO to terminate my TA appointment \-\-> **5/3
  of a letter grades**
- Own my computer and give yourself an A+ \-\-> **Automatic A+**

Happy hunting!

#### Midterm 2 Logistics[^1] [Spring 2020]

In light of the campus directive that prohibits live Zoom proctoring, we have
changed the format of Midterm 2. It will now be held online at 5:00pm PST,
April 6 and proctored through Club Penguin. Please read this entire post
carefully, as it contains many important rules we expect everyone to follow to
ensure a fair midterm for all.

**Before the midterm**:

Please create a penguin with a name that we can easily identify you with. We
understand that some common names may be taken, so if you cannot create an
identifiable name, please make a private post with your username before the
exam starts.

Examples of good penguin names: evanbot, evanbot161, evan_bot

Examples of bad penguin names: XxX\_\_bot_of_the_evan_19340328\_\_XxX,
hack_me_daddy_evan

Day of the midterm:

Please join the Antarctic server and congregate before 5:10pm PST at the Dojo.
We recommend logging in once before the exam so you don't need to search for
the Dojo on the day of the exam. TAs have found that the ski lift may be a
useful shortcut if you're running short on time.

If you arrive early, please be mindful of other test takers before the exam
starts. In particular, **snowball fights are not allowed at any time**. Any
student caught starting a snowball fight may be reported for academic
dishonesty and/or reported to the Club Penguin moderators.

Each student is allowed one cheat puffle to consult during the exam. The puffle
must be raised by yourself - you are not allowed to gift a cheat puffle to
another student. Please make sure your puffle is well-fed before the exam. We
will not be allowing any feeding during the exam and are not responsible for
any puffle deaths that occur during the exam.

The exam is multiple-choice and will be administered through Card-Jitsu. At
5:10, a proctor will direct you to a Card-Jitsu game, and a PDF of the
questions will be posted on the course website. To answer a question, play one
of the following cards:

- Play a snow card to choose answer A
- Play a fire card to choose answer B
- Play a water card to choose answer C

Using power cards against your proctor is prohibited. Any student caught using
a power card will be reported for academic dishonesty and/or reported to the
Club Penguin moderators.

The exam ends at exactly 6:30pm PST. All penguins must stay at the dojo until
all exams are confirmed to be received, at which point you are allowed to
return to your igloos. Please remember to take your cheat puffles with you.
Course staff is not responsible for feeding any cheat puffles left behind.

We understand that this exam format is new for everyone. If you have any
questions, please post a follow-up.

Thank you for your interest in EB 101. This is a light, fluffy 4-unit course
designed to introduce you to the many wonders and practical applications of
pancakes.

We will be using Goolang for the course - if you have time at the beginning of
the semester, please go through some tutorials to get yourself familiar with
the language.

Syllabus:

Week 1  | What are pancakes?
Week 2  | Introduction to stack

Week 14 | NOPancake week
Week 15 | Final Exam: Bake your own pancake

Pizza:

If you have a question, the best way to contact us is via [the class Pizza
oven](https://piazza.com/berkeley/spring2021/cs161). The staff (Bot and TAs)
will check the oven regularly.

Collaboration Policy:

Bot believes that most students can distinguish between tasting and eating.
Sharing a subtle point about stacking or garnishing is an interaction that we
encourage, but you must write your recipes strictly by yourself (with your
partner on projects). You must not ask for a pre-made stack on Stack Exchange
or other online sites; although you may ask for help with conceptual questions.

Ethics:

Bot will be discussing batters in this class, some of them quite sticky. None
of this is in any way an invitation to eat them raw other than with explicit
approval of recipe owners and the FDA. The existence of edible cookie dough is
no excuse. These issues concern not only professional ethics, but also UCB
policy and state and federal law. If there is any question in your mind about
what conduct is allowable, contact the instructors first.

#### Welcome to DOGGO 161! [Spring 2022]

Hello!

Welcome to DOGGO 161: Defense Against the Feline Arts! While we may not have
the full semester remaining ahead of us, we’re excited to learn about attack
and defense systems, cognitive memory-based security, spellcasting, and
doggogram- and barkstream-based attacks!

We have been made aware that some of you thought you were enrolled in another
course titled CS 161. The Cats and Sciences department has informed us that
they are offering no such course, and we suspect that feline operatives from
Sphynxford Junior College are targeting students at UC Barkeley using memory
safety attacks, to increase their university standing. We are working closely
with officials to discuss the best way to respond.

If you’ve been affected by this, we hope you’ll be able to quickly catch up
with the course content. The current website has the current, up-to-date
schedule and syllabus. We recommend you look over the content and let us know
if you have any questions!

Looking forward to a great semester with you all!

-DOGGO 161 staff
