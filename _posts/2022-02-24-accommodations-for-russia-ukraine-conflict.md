> This is the text of a post we released to students on Piazza affirming our commitment to support students in the middle of the escalating crisis in Ukraine. It's important to make sure that students feel supported during times of geopolitical crises. One way of doing this is to reassure students that their current emotions during such times are valid and they have the full support of the course staff to ensure that their mental and physical health are taken care of first before attending to course matter.

As some of you may be aware, as of earlier this morning, the Russia and Ukraine conflict has escalated. While this may not affect all of you, some students may be strongly affected, either directly or by having family or personal connections to the areas at war.

We don't know how long this will last, or what other nations this will eventually affect, but we want to remind you all about our natural/national/general disaster policy. If you lose access to power, WiFi, safe places to work, or are just generally emotionally or physically affected, this is considered an extenuating circumstance. Please do not hesitate to reach out for extensions or any additional support you may need!

We're also aware a large number of students are in Berkeley right now, but may have family or connections to the area. If that's your situation, please take the time and space you need right now to process the information, stay up to date with whatever news you need to, and be there to support your family! Our goal is to help you. If extensions or other support is needed, we'll do our best to work with you to find a solution.

In any case, your well-being, both physically and emotionally, is top priority, and we'll do whatever we can to help with that.
