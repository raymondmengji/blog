> This post contains a snapshot of our student-facing exam logistics for the Spring 2022 Final! Feel free to adapt these logistics to your class's exam procedure, and see our other exam-related posts for recommendations and guidelines on how to offer hybrid exams.

# Exam Logistics

The midterm exam will be held in-person on **Friday, February 25, 7:00--9:00 PM PT**.

The final exam will be held in-person on **Thursday, May 12, 3:00--6:00 PM PT**.

If you would like to request an online exam for any reason or would like to request an alternate exam time, please fill out the appropriate exam adjustments form:

* [Midterm Adjustments Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfJihSCSN9IH0T7pYKhFAKTmPvkHSHbLB6q11ldh-bsirWAow/viewform)
* [Final Adjustments Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYez78x1RX50mxVcTFQbGfMbTYwYQVoBtk3QSGCgUGJDazGQ/viewform)

## Scope

* The midterm scope is everything up to the end of the cryptography module: Lectures 1--12, Discussions 1--5, Homeworks 1--3, and Project 1.
* The final scope is everything covered through the class: Lectures 1--24, Discussions 1--12, Homeworks 1--7, and Projects 1--3.
* The textbook is a supplemental resource but is not officially in scope.

## Cheat Sheets

* Students may prepare and bring use 2 two-sided cheat sheets for the midterm and 4 two-sided cheat sheets for the final. You may reuse your cheat sheets on the midterm for the final.
* Cheat sheets must be handwritten. Handwritten tablet notes may be printed and used. If you have handwritten tablet notes but no printer access, let us in a private post on Piazza.

## In-Person Exam Logistics

* In-person exams will be conducted in assigned exam rooms. You will receive confirmation of your exam room and seat number in the days leading up to the exam.

## Online Exam Logistics

* Online exams will be conducted via Zoom proctoring. Students will receive a Zoom link and name(s) of their proctors in the days leading up to the exam.
* If you'd prefer to upload a local recording instead of using Zoom, or you'd prefer to record a screen share and webcam feed instead, please reach out privately.
* If you feel uncomfortable with proctoring, please reach out so you can discuss alternatives with an instructor.

* **Before the exam:**
  * Download Zoom on your smartphone and experiment with a video recording setup (see below). [You can see examples of setups from course staff here.](/sample-setups.html) Please reach out privately on Piazza if you are having setup difficulties.
* **On the day of the exam:**
  * Join the Zoom meeting and position your smartphone so that we can clearly see your computer/tablet screen, and if possible, both of your hands. The exam won't start until everyone's in the Zoom room, so you may have to wait a few minutes.
  * When the proctor has announced that the exam has started, the decryption password will be posted on Examtool.
* **During the exam:**
  * Only the 61A Examtool page should be on your computer screen.
  * Submit clarification requests through the 61A Examtool. If your question is answered, it will be displayed as an announcement. Please check the announcements periodically during the exam.
* **Technical issues:**
  * Don't worry if your video feed disconnects briefly during the exam.
  * If you encounter significant technical problems, don't worry about video proctoring and focus on finishing the exam.
  * We may ask some students to take a short verbal exam after the exam and explain how to solve one or more problems that are similar to an exam question they got right.
  * If you encounter Internet problems, write your answers locally and send them to cs161-staff@berkeley.edu as soon as the exam is over.
  * If you need to use the bathroom, just leave the video feed on while you're away.
* **Privacy policy:**
  * Course staff will not save any images or recordings from the proctoring session after the exam is over.
  * Course staff will respect your privacy and not disclose any information from the proctoring session after the exam, except in cases of academic dishonesty.
  * Every case of potential academic dishonesty will be manually reviewed, and you'll be able to discuss the situation with the instructor.
  * You have the option to join the meeting with your SID as your display name for anonymity.
  * We will tell you who your proctor is before the exam. You have the option to switch proctors for any reason: please reach out privately before the exam if you would like to switch proctors.
